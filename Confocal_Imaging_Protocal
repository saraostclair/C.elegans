Microscope: Nikon Eclipse Ti
Software: NIS-Elements
Objective: 40x Oil Immersion

1. Startup & Login
	• Turn on the microscope, laser system, and computer.
	• Open NIS-Elements software.
	• Log in using Student profile.

2. Initial Microscope Setup
	• Apply immersion oil to the 40x objective.
	• Place slide on the stage.
	• Locate the worm using the eyepiece (EPI light):
		○ No filter cube selected
		○ Use white light only (transmitted illumination off).
	• Center the worm in the field of view manually.

3. Software Setup: Channel Configuration
	• Under the Nikon 2 configuration, select the YFP channel (Alexa Fluor 488).
	• Ensure only the 488 nm laser is activated.
		○ Laser Power: 1.0%
		○ Gain: 76
		○ Offset: -127

4. Z-Stack Parameters
	• Click Z-stack acquisition.
	• Set the Z-range:
		○ Total depth: ~25 µm
		○ Step size: 1 µm
	• Ensure that the center of the worm is aligned with the midpoint of the Z-stack.

5. Image Stitching Setup (if needed)
	• If using Large Image Scan:
		○ Set Image Size: 1 x 1 field from microscope set point (or to correct size for the position of the worm)
		○ Set Overlap: 20% (for proper blending)

6. Final Checks
	• Confirm all laser settings and stage position.
	• Make sure immersion oil forms a proper interface between lens and slide.
	• Ensure the coverslip is not cracked and sample is stable.

7. Acquire Image
