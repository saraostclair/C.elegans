Step-by-Step Summary of My C. elegans Data Analysis

1. Cleared the R Environment
I started by clearing the R workspace using rm(list = ls()) to remove all existing objects and ensure a fresh,
clean environment.

2. Identified Issues with Column Headers
While inspecting the raw data files, I discovered that some CSV files contained misspelled or inconsistent
column headers, such as "aagr_area", "X", "Area", and "worm_ID". These inconsistencies caused extra
columns to appear and led to misaligned data.

3. Checked Which Files Contained Incorrect Columns
To locate the problematic files, I wrote a script to scan the headers of all CSV files in my raw data folder
(data_original) and identify those containing the misspelled or unwanted column names.

4. Organized Data Files into Separate Folders
For clarity and reproducibility, I organized my files into three folders:
- data_original - containing the raw CSV files with header errors
- data_fixed - containing manually corrected CSV files with consistent column names
- dataset_final - the output folder where the cleaned and combined dataset would be saved

5. Combined Corrected CSV Files
I read all the cleaned CSV files from the data_fixed folder and combined them into one large dataframe by
stacking the rows using bind_rows().

6. Saved the Combined Dataset
The combined dataset was saved as celegans_data_final.csv inside the dataset_final folder to keep the data
organized.

7. Renamed the Dataset Object in R

After loading the combined dataset into R, I renamed the dataframe object to celegans_data_final for
consistent reference throughout my analysis.

8. Handled File Path Issues by Using Full Paths
To avoid errors related to working directories, I used full absolute file paths when reading from and writing to
CSV files and ensured folders existed before saving.

9. Data Normalization and Factor Conversion
I converted key variables such as age and treatment into factor types with specified levels. I also added new
normalized columns (norm_aggr_num, norm_aggr_area, norm_IntDen) by dividing aggregation
measurements by the worm area to standardize across samples.
