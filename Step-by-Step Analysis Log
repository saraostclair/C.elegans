Step-by-Step Summary of My C. elegans Data Analysis

1. Cleared the R Environment
I started by clearing my R workspace using the command rm(list = ls()) to remove all existing objects
and ensure a fresh environment.

2. Identified Issues with Column Headers
I discovered some CSV files had misspelled column headers like "aagr_area", "X", "Area", and
"worm_ID", which caused extra columns and misaligned data.

3. Checked Which Files Had Incorrect Columns
I wrote a script to scan all CSV files to identify those with problematic column names so I could
locate and fix them.

4. Organized Data Files into Folders
I sorted my data into three folders:
- data_original (raw files with errors)
- data_fixed (corrected CSVs with proper headers)
- dataset_final (intended folder to save the combined dataset)

5. Combined Corrected CSV Files
I combined all CSVs from the data_fixed folder into one large dataset by reading and stacking their
rows.

6. Saved the Combined Dataset
I saved the combined dataset as dataset_final.csv inside the dataset_final folder.

7. Renamed the Dataset Object
Since the saved file name was not what I initially wanted, I manually renamed the dataset in R to
celegan_data to keep consistent naming for analysis.

8. Handled File Path Issues
To avoid working directory errors, I used full folder paths in my code for reading and writing files
