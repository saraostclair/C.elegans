C. elegans celegans_data_final Dataset – Column Descriptions (Ordered)

Aggr – Index number automatically assigned by ImageJ to each aggregate (unitless).

Area – Size of the aggregate in square micrometers (µm²) if a scale was set, or in pixel² if not.

Mean – Average pixel intensity (mean gray value) within the aggregate; reported in arbitrary units (a.u.) of fluorescence intensity.

StdDev – Standard deviation of pixel intensity values within the aggregate (a.u.).

Min – Minimum pixel intensity value detected within the aggregate (a.u.).

Max – Maximum pixel intensity value detected within the aggregate (a.u.).

IntDen – Integrated density of the aggregate, calculated as Area × Mean gray value; represents total fluorescence intensity (a.u. × µm², or a.u. × pixel² if unscaled).

RawIntDen – Sum of all pixel intensity values within the aggregate (∑ pixel values); reported in a.u. and not scaled.

N – Experiment replicate identifier (N1, N2, or N3).

age – Developmental age of the worms at the time of imaging.
Values: L4+1, L4+7, and L4+14.

treatment – Indicates whether the worm received control or mannitol treatment.

wormID – Unique identifier for each worm in the format
[C/M][worm#]_N[replicate]_D[day]
(e.g., C1_N1_D1).

worm_area – Total measured area of the individual worm (µm²); used for normalization.

norm_aggr_num – Number of aggregates normalized to worm size (aggregates per µm² of worm area).

norm_aggr_area – Aggregate area normalized to worm size (µm² of aggregate area per µm² of worm area).

norm_IntDen – Integrated aggregate fluorescence intensity normalized to worm size (IntDen per µm² of worm area).
