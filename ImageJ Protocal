To get aggregate size, count and total fluorescence per aggregate 
	1. Straight line tool to measure distance provided by confocal -> analyze -> measure (to get pixels)
	2. Analyze -> set scale (enter pixels and known length)
	3. Image -> type -> 8-bit
	4. Image -> adjust -> threshold
		a. Check dark background
		b. Default / red
		c. Set threshold lower to 30 and upper to 60
	5. Analyze -> set measurements 
		a. Check : area, mean gray value, min and max gray value, and integrated density
	6. Analyze -> analyze particles 
		a. Size =  4-infinity
		b. Circularity =  0.30-1.00
		c. Show = bare outlines
		d. Check
			i. Display results
			ii. Add to manager

To get worm size
	1. Set scale
	2. Using freehand tool outline the worm
	3. Analyze -> measure -> area
